Agenda:
	Technology choices (Sector/UDT, FDT, RBUDP, Hadoop)
	Defining Transfer Loads
	    Using baseline of 200 images, est compressed size for
		raw DES images
	    Estimate size of CommPipe reduced to be replicated
	    DES nightly calibration back to Chile?
	Required Testing 
	    Current transfer speeds (CTIO-LaSerena, Chile-NCSA, Chile-Tuc,
		and  NCSA-TUC -- in both direction)
	    Bake-off testing of protocols
	Requirements Definition
	Project Scope and Schedule
	Open Questions and Who Answers Them


Open Questions:
    -	How does DECam data get into the system from the telescope?
    -	What does it mean to "deliver data to NCSA" (directory drop-off,
	interface with a DB, trigger a pipeline, etc)?
    -	How do we identify DES vs community image?
    -	What are constraints on what we can do at NCSA (run a daemon, open
	a firewall hole, etc)?  Who manages that (i.e. can we update s/w 
	ourselves or wait on admin)?
    -	How are data "delivered" to the Archive for ingestion?
    -	If raw images move over separate system, does CommPipe replication
	move over existing DCI?  Is transfer speed adequate?  Is there a
	CP North and South?
    -	What is the policy for catching up after network outage (i.e. 
	oldest or newest images first?)?
    -	Is there an evolution of this system to the rest of E2E?
